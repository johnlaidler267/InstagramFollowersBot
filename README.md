# Social Engagement Generator
A Python script which uses Selenium WebDriver to gradually generate followers for a given user's instagram account. Features automated mass following to increase activity, unfollowing of those accounts which don't follow back, and a gui menu (made using the pygames library) for inputing username/password and specifying which account to draw followers from.

**NOTE: Still under construction.
